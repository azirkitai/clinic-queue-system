### 2. Server Configuration ✅

## 📋 Before You Deploy

### Step 1: Verify System
Run the verification script:
```bash
./safe-deploy.sh
```

You should see:
```
✅ Images stored in permanent object storage
✅ Database configured and ready
✅ WebSocket real-time updates enabled
🚀 SAFE TO DEPLOY!
```

### Step 2: Check Media URLs (Development)
```bash
# Check if URLs are correct format
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT id, name, url FROM media LIMIT 5;"
```

All URLs should start with `/replit-objstore-`

## 🔧 After Deployment

### If Images Don't Load in Production:

**Symptoms:**
- Broken image icons in Media Settings
- URLs show as `/1759313957433_10.png` (missing full path)

**Cause:**
- Production database has old URLs without full object storage path

**Solution Options:**

#### Option A: Delete & Re-upload (Simple) ✅
1. Go to **Settings → Media Settings**
2. Click **delete** on broken images
3. Upload images again
4. New uploads will use correct URL format

#### Option B: SQL Fix (If many images) ⚙️
1. Backup production database first!
2. Use the provided `fix-media-urls.sql` script
3. Run via Replit Database Tool on PRODUCTION database
4. Verify changes before uncommenting UPDATE statement

---

## 🎯 Deploy Now!

Once you see "🚀 SAFE TO DEPLOY!" from the script, you can deploy with confidence:

1. **Click "Deploy" button** in Replit
2. **Wait for build** to complete (2-3 minutes)
3. **TV auto-reconnects** - no manual refresh needed
4. **Verify media loads** in Settings page

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Images still broken after deploy
**Fix**: Run Option A or B above to fix URLs

### Problem: TV not updating
**Fix**: TV auto-reconnects. If stuck, refresh browser once.

### Problem: Upload new image fails
**Check**: 
- Object storage directory exists
- File size < 10MB
- Format is PNG or JPEG
